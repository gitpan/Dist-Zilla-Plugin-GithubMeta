NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GithubMeta - Automatically include GitHub meta
    information in META.yml

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini

      [GithubMeta]

      # to override the homepage

      [GithubMeta]
      homepage = http://some.sort.of.url/project/

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GithubMeta is a Dist::Zilla plugin to include
    GitHub <http://github.com> meta information in "META.yml".

    It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under "git"
    version control and whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository and will
    set the "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" to the
    appropriate URLs for GitHub.

  ATTRIBUTES
    "homepage"
        You may override the "homepage" setting by specifying this
        attribute. This should be a valid URL as understood by
        MooseX::Types::URI.

  METHODS
    "metadata"
        Required by Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider
