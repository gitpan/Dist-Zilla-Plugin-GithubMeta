DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GithubMeta is a Dist::Zilla plugin to include
    GitHub <http://github.com> meta information in "META.yml".

    It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under "git"
    version control and whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository and will
    set the "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" to the
    appropriate URLs for GitHub.

    Based on Module::Install::GithubMeta which was based on
    Module::Install::Repository by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

  ATTRIBUTES
    "remote"
        The GitHub remote repo can be overriden with this attribute. If not
        provided, it defaults to "origin".

    "homepage"
        You may override the "homepage" setting by specifying this
        attribute. This should be a valid URL as understood by
        MooseX::Types::URI.

  METHODS
