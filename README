DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GithubMeta is a Dist::Zilla plugin to include
    GitHub <https://github.com> meta information in "META.yml".

    It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under "git"
    version control and whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository and will
    set the "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" to the
    appropriate URLs for GitHub.

    Based on Module::Install::GithubMeta which was based on
    Module::Install::Repository by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

  ATTRIBUTES
    "remote"
        The GitHub remote repo can be overriden with this attribute. If not
        provided, it defaults to "origin". You can provide multiple remotes
        to inspect. The first one that looks like a GitHub remote is used.

    "homepage"
        You may override the "homepage" setting by specifying this
        attribute. This should be a valid URL as understood by
        MooseX::Types::URI.

    "issues"
        If true, a bugtracker URL will be added to the distribution metadata
        for the project's GitHub issues page.

    "user"
        If given, the "user" parameter overrides the username found in the
        GitHub repository URL. This is useful if many people might release
        from their own workstations, but the distribution metadata should
        always point to one user's repo.

    "repo"
        If give, the "repo" parameter overrides the repository name found in
        the GitHub repository URL.

  METHODS
    "metadata"
        Required by Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider
